This project aims to analyse a sales dataset comprising 40,000 records to extract actionable insights and develop an interactive Power BI report. The dataset encompasses various aspects of sales operations, including order details, customer information, product categories, sales regions, payment methods, and salesperson performance. The Power BI report is structured into four interconnected pages, designed to provide a comprehensive view of sales activities and inform strategic decision-making.
Problem Statement
The company lacks a consolidated, interactive reporting tool to effectively monitor and analyze sales performance. This absence results in:
•	Limited Visibility: Difficulty in understanding overall sales trends, product performance, and customer behaviour.
•	Inefficient Decision-Making: Inability to quickly identify areas for improvement or optimization.
•	Lack of Granular Analysis: Challenges in drilling down into specific regions, products, or customer segments.
•	Time-Consuming Reporting: Reliance on manual data extraction and analysis, leading to delays in generating reports.
Solution Approach
To address these challenges, this project implements the following solution approach:
1.	Data Integration: Import the sales dataset into Power BI Desktop.
2.	Data Modelling: Create relationships between tables, as needed, to ensure data integrity and enable comprehensive analysis.
3.	Report Development: Design a four-page Power BI report with the following structure:
•	Page 1: Sales Overview: Summary of overall sales performance using cards, charts, and slicers.
•	Page 2: Product Performance: Analysis of product sales by category and individual products.
•	Page 3: Customer & Payment Insights: Examination of customer demographics, payment method preferences, and customer segmentation.
•	Page 4: Salesperson & Order Details: Evaluation of salesperson performance and detailed order information.
4.	Interactive Features: Implement slicers, filters, and drill-through capabilities to enable users to explore the data interactively.
5.	KPI Implementation: Incorporate key performance indicators (KPIs) to provide quick insights into critical metrics.

Key Findings 
Based on the dataset structure and solution approach, the following key findings are anticipated:
•	Sales Trends: Identification of overall sales growth or decline, seasonal patterns, and regional variations.
•	Top-Performing Products: Determination of the best-selling products and categories, along with factors contributing to their success.
•	Customer Segmentation: Identification of key customer segments based on demographics, purchase behaviour, and payment preferences.
•	Salesperson Performance: Evaluation of individual salesperson contributions to overall sales, identification of top performers, and areas for improvement.
•	Payment Method Analysis: Insights into the most popular payment methods, potential fraud patterns, and opportunities for optimizing payment processing.
•	Regional Insights: Understanding of sales performance in different regions, including top-selling products, customer preferences, and salesperson effectiveness.
